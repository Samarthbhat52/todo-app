## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- Mobile-first workflow
- [React](https://reactjs.org/) - JS library
- [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) - React framework

### What I learned

This was my first time using React to create a webpage.
Learnt the the use of states, forms, components, props, redirects, conditional theme rendering and much more in this simple project.

I was not able to get the drag to rearrange feature working, so that's something to look forward to in the next project i pick up.
*

### Continued development

Going forward, I will be focusing on working with multiple components, redirecting efficiently and forms.
